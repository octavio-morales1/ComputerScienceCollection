Map 1 (Empty Room):
0 **x* -> W 0
0 **W* -> X 1
1 x*** -> N 1
1 N*** -> S 2
2 ***x -> S 2
2 ***S -> E 1

Map 2 (Maze):
0 x*** -> N 1
0 N*** -> X 2
1 *x** -> E 3
1 *E** -> X 0
2 **x* -> W 0
2 **W* -> X 3
3 ***x -> S 2
3 ***S -> X 1

I was given help by Audie Breslin in solving Map 2, as there was a loop problem.

I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.
