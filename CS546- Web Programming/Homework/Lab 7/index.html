            <h2>Puerto Rico</h2>
            <p>Traveling to Puerto Rico offers an enchanting experience with its nature, rich history, and vibrant culture. From the moment you step foot on the country, you're greeted with the warm embrace of its tropical climate. Exploring my father's home country means wandering through the wondrous streets of Old San Juan, where centuries-old fortresses stand guard over the coast, and lively plazas are filled with the aromas of local cuisine. Whether you're relaxing on a sun-kissed beach, hiking through the lush El Yunque rainforest, or savoring the flavors of Puerto Rican delicacies (my personal favorite being empanadas), every experience is a celebration of the island's diverse heritage and natural wonders, making for a truly memorable journey.</p>
