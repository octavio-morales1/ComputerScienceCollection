            <h2>Exploring Tokyo</h2>
            <cite>August 22, 2023</cite>
            <p>Today, I visited the Tokyo Skytree. The view from the top was breathtaking, and I could see the entire city spread out before me. Later on, I visted Shibuya City, and was truly a night to never forget as I found a maid cafe (not even lying).</p>

            <cite>June 20, 2022</cite>
            <p>The hike through the Andes mountains was challenging but worth it. The sight of Machu Picchu is something I will never forget with my family. The blend of nature and ancient Incan architecture was truly inspiring.</p>

            <cite>July 10, 2021</cite>
            <p>Walking through the streets of Old San Juan was like stepping back in time. The colorful buildings and cobble streets were very interesting. Tasting empanadas at a local eatery was a delicious end to the day.</p>
